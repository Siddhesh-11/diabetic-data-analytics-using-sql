## Introduction

In the modern healthcare landscape, data analytics plays a crucial role in enhancing patient care, optimizing resource management, and ensuring financial sustainability. This project leverages SQL to conduct an in-depth analysis of healthcare data, providing valuable insights that can drive informed decision-making and improve hospital operations.

## The Backstory

Data analytics offers transformative benefits for the healthcare industry, including:

- **Proactive Health Management:** By analyzing patient data, hospitals can identify at-risk patients early and implement preventive measures. This proactive approach can reduce the incidence of severe health issues and improve overall patient health outcomes.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Data analytics helps streamline hospital operations by optimizing staffing, reducing wait times, and improving patient flow. Efficient resource management leads to better patient care and reduced operational costs.
- **Personalized Medical Care:** Utilizing data to understand individual patient needs and responses to treatments enables hospitals to provide personalized medical care. This tailored approach enhances treatment effectiveness and patient satisfaction.

Balancing cost control with delivering high-quality patient care is a persistent challenge for hospitals. This requires a data-centric approach focused on continuous improvement. Effective cost management is essential for the hospital's financial health. Key metrics such as Facility Utilization—encompassing occupancy rates, patient stay durations, and bed utilization—are crucial for reducing overhead costs and increasing revenue.

## The Scenario

As a Data Scientist at a hospital, you have been tasked by the C-Suite to prepare a detailed report addressing the following questions:

1. **What is the typical length of stay for patients in the hospital?**
2. **Is there a correlation between the number of lab procedures and the duration of hospital stay?**
3. **What are the different racial groups present in the dataset, and how are they distributed in terms of lab procedures?**
4. **What are the gender distributions in the dataset?**
5. **Which medical specialties have the highest average number of procedures?**
6. **What is the readmission rate for different medical specialties?**
7. **Which age groups have the highest average number of procedures and medications?**

## The Data

The dataset for this project, sourced from a Kaggle challenge on predicting hospital readmission rates for diabetic patients, includes clinical care data from 130 U.S. hospitals over a ten-year period (1998 - 2008). It comprises two tables: one with demographic information and the other with health and clinical care data.

## Purpose and Approach

This project aims to practice advanced SQL techniques to extract and analyze meaningful insights from the dataset. Techniques used in this project include:

- **JOINS** to combine data from multiple tables.
- **CASE statements** to create conditional logic within queries.
- **HAVING clauses** to filter groups of rows.
- **Subqueries** to perform operations on the results of other queries.
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** to simplify complex queries.
- **Correlated Subqueries** to refer to columns from the outer query.
